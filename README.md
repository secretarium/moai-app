# Moai

## What is Moai?
Moai is a smart, secure contact tracing solution created by [Secretarium](https://secretarium.com/), a deep-tech startup founded in 2016 with the aim of building useful technology that never compromises anyone’s privacy. Unlike the NHS contact tracing technology, our app is compatible with all iOS and Android devices. Our solution is cross-border, enabling notifications for those who may have been affected outside the UK.

The founders are from the world of banking, but they left to pursue projects that would solve problems around handling highly sensitive data: enforcing consent, and guaranteeing privacy by design and by default.

## Why is it smart?
Until now, privacy has been limited to encrypting data during transit and storage. Our technology keeps data private at all times, even while it’s being used, through a combination of tamper-proof code and secure hardware. Because the data is always encrypted, even somebody with physical access to the storage centre would not be able to extract any information.

The privacy-preserving technology used in Moai is the latest generation in confidential computing, and has already been tried and tested by financial institutions in the UK and Europe. No personal information is required to use the app, and we don’t access your phone’s geolocation system.

## Developing Moai
This repository contains code for Moai's [mobile app](https://github.com/secretarium/moai-app/tree/master/packages/mobile) and Moai's [portal](https://github.com/secretarium/moai-app/tree/master/packages/portal). Technologies involved in the creation of Moai include [React](https://reactjs.org/), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), and [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/).
