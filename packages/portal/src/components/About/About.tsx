                    Moai is a smart, secure contact tracing solution created by Secretarium,
                    a deep-tech startup founded in 2016 with the aim of building useful technology
                    that never compromises anyoneâ€™s privacy.
                    The founders are from the world of banking, but they left to pursue projects
                    that would solve problems around handling highly sensitive data:
                    enforcing consent and guaranteeing privacy by design and by default.
